# Feature Engineering for Book Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on feature engineering techniques within the context of machine learning, aimed at transforming raw data into informative features that enhance model performance and interpretability. Emphasis is placed on data preprocessing, feature creation, and the effects of these processes on predictive outcomes.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply various feature engineering techniques.
- Explore methods for selecting and creating relevant features.
- Assess the impact of preprocessing on model performance, rather than accuracy.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project is a Book Price dataset that provides key attributes related to various books. Each entry contains the following features:- **Title**: Unique identifier for each book.
- **Author**: The writer(s) of the book, influencing perceptions and marketability.
- **Edition**: Specific version details, impacting rarity and desirability.
- **Reviews**: User feedback indicating popularity.
- **Ratings**: Scores given by readers reflecting quality.
- **Synopsis**: Summary of the book's content.
- **Genre**: The category of the book.
- **BookCategory**: Broader classification context.
- **Price**: Target variable for prediction.

## Tasks Overview
The assignment emphasizes the following tasks related to feature engineering and data preprocessing:

1. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Identify and manage missing values, and handle outliers effectively.
Scaling and Normalization: Apply techniques to ensure that features are on a similar scale, which is vital for many machine learning algorithms.
Categorical Variable Handling: Implement methods like one-hot encoding and label encoding to convert categorical data into a format suitable for model training.
2. Feature Creation
New Feature Generation: Explore techniques for creating additional features from existing ones. This includes:

Polynomial Features: Generating new features based on polynomial combinations of existing features.
Interaction Features: Creating features that capture interactions between different variables.
Domain-Specific Engineering: Tailoring features based on domain knowledge, which can provide additional insights.
Feature Extraction: Employ methods to extract meaningful features from unstructured data, such as text analysis of the book synopsis.

3. Implementation
While a specific machine learning model (e.g., RandomForestRegressor) can be used for training, the assignment focuses on the effectiveness of the preprocessing pipeline rather than model accuracy.
The provided code skeleton serves as a starting point for implementing the feature engineering process.
4. Reporting
Prepare a detailed report that outlines the methods and techniques used throughout the project. This report should:
Discuss the preprocessing steps taken and their impact on the data.
Explain the logic behind the feature engineering choices made.
Include visualizations (without any code) to illustrate the findings and insights gained from the data.

## Data Preprocessing
### Steps Involved
1. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values and outliers.
2. **Scaling, Normalization, and Standardization**: Ensure consistent feature scales for improved model performance.
3. **Handling Categorical Variables**: Utilize techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding to convert categorical data into numerical formats.

### Feature Engineering & Transformation
1. **Feature Creation**: 
   - Techniques like polynomial features, interaction features, and domain-specific engineering are explored.
   - Text feature extraction methods, particularly from the synopsis, are implemented.

2. **Authors Analysis**: Clean and standardize author data to a uniform format.

3. **Edition Analysis**: Extract meaningful attributes from the edition information.

4. **Popularity Column**: Create a weighted value of ratings to assess book popularity.

5. **Handling Null Values**: Fill missing values with the mode of each column.

6. **Normalization**: Adjust features like reviews and ratings to a common scale for better visualization.

### Visualization
- Use various visualization techniques (e.g., bar plots, box plots) to analyze numerical and categorical features.
- Generate a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

## Implementation
- Utilize a specified model (e.g., RandomForestRegressor) for training and prediction.
- Evaluate the preprocessing pipeline rather than model accuracy, highlighting the significance of feature engineering.

## Results
- Present the impact of preprocessing techniques on model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
- Analyze feature importance from the Random Forest model to identify the most influential features.

## Conclusion
This assignment reinforces the importance of robust feature engineering and preprocessing in machine learning. It highlights the necessity of transforming raw data into meaningful features and the impact of these transformations on predictive models. Through this project, students gain practical experience in applying various techniques that enhance data usability and model interpretability.
