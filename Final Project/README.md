## Project Implementation

### Team Members
- Mehrdad Baradaran
- Katayoun Kobraei

### Project Overview
In this project, we employed neural networks and deep learning techniques to tackle the problem of predicting side effects from drug combinations. Our work focused on Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction.

1. **Understanding Drug Interaction Data**: 
   - We analyzed datasets containing comprehensive drug information and their interactions. This included features like chemical structures, targets, enzymes, and known side effects.

2. **Addressing Data Challenges**: 
   - The datasets posed significant challenges such as sparsity, imbalance, and incomplete information. We implemented strategies to overcome these issues, ensuring our models could learn effectively from the available data.

3. **Proposed Methodologies**:
   - **Approach 1**: Developed a dual-model neural network that combines an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a classifier for predicting side effects. This design aimed to mitigate data imbalance and enhance feature representation.
   - **Approach 2**: Introduced a method for calculating drug similarity using Jaccard similarity, which helps in feature extraction and improves prediction performance by leveraging similar drug properties.
   - **Approach 3**: Integrated the first two approaches to create a robust model that utilizes both advanced feature extraction and effective classification strategies.

4. **Evaluation and Results**: 
   - We evaluated our models using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUPRC, AUROC) to compare their performance against baseline methods like k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Our results demonstrated that the integrated approach significantly outperformed existing state-of-the-art models.

## Key Findings
- The combined approach successfully addressed issues of data imbalance and sparsity, leading to higher prediction accuracy and better interpretability of drug interactions.
- The results highlighted the importance of leveraging multiple data sources and advanced neural network architectures to improve DDI prediction.

## Future Directions
Future work could explore incorporating more extensive datasets, experimenting with different neural network architectures, and enhancing preprocessing techniques for better feature extraction.
