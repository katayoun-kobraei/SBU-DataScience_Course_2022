# Statistical Analysis Assignment

## Overview
This assignment involves conducting statistical analysis on two of four provided datasets. The focus will be on using descriptive and inferential statistics to explore the datasets, answer relevant questions, and present findings in a report. 

## Datasets
We chose two of the following datasets for our analysis:

1. **House Prices**: A dataset containing information on residential properties, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and sale prices.
   - **Key Questions**:
