# EDA & Data Visualization Assignment

## Overview
This assignment focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, particularly in the context of understanding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The goal is to clean the dataset, analyze trends and patterns, and present findings through insightful visualizations.

## Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed outliers and handled null values effectively.
   - Ensured the dataset was in a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed a thorough analysis of the cleaned data to uncover trends, correlations, and insights related to the pandemic.
   - Utilized complex visualizations to represent findings.

3. **Creative Visualization**:
   - Developed innovative visualizations that go beyond basic charts and graphs.
   - Used various tools and techniques to illustrate patterns in the data.

## Dataset : COVID-19 Dataset
**Warning**: Their GitHub datasets are no longer updated since 19 August 2024. 

You can access the CSV version of the COVID-19 dataset via Our World in Data's data catalog: [COVID-19 Dataset CSV](https://catalog.ourworldindata.org/garden/covid/latest/compact/compact.csv).

### Project Structure
The project contains two independent directories:

- **public/data**: Contains the final datasets for individuals interested in consuming the data and understanding all the caveats about it and its metrics.
- **scripts**: Contains all the code and intermediate files to produce the final dataset, aimed at those interested in contributing to the project or gaining insight into our internal technical processes.
