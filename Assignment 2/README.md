# EDA & Data Visualization Assignment

## Overview
This assignment focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, particularly in the context of understanding the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The goal is to clean the dataset, analyze trends and patterns, and present findings through insightful visualizations.

## Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - I Removed outliers and handled null values effectively.
   - Then I ensured the dataset was in a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - I performed a thorough analysis of the cleaned data to uncover trends, correlations, and insights related to the pandemic.
   - I utilized complex visualizations to represent findings.

3. **Creative Visualization**:
   - We develop innovative visualizations that go beyond basic charts and graphs.
   - We use various tools and techniques to illustrate patterns in the data.
